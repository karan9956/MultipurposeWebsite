        title: "The Bermuda Triangle, Atlantic Ocean",
        description: "Legends of lost sailors and missing ships, wrecked planes, and even people who have disappeared for centuries have come from the waters of the Bermuda Triangle. More than half a million square miles [half a million sq km], also known as the Devil's Triangle, is full of ideas about why so many travelers fall. Some say that there is a magnetic field tossing the compass at a crossroads, others say that tropical cyclones are the culprits, and still others say that there is no mystery at all! Today, a visit to this area may be far more enjoyable than you realize, as the sun-drenched Turks and Caicos Islands face south of the Bermuda estuary to the north.",

        description: "With the variation of Stephen King's Timberline Lodge and Stanley Kubrick's fame The Shining, the Banff Springs Hotel of Canada is said to be home to a host of ghost stories and mysterious events. Local people tell stories of the whole family who died of a cold in 873 rooms. Some talked about the gatekeepers who went out and disappeared. But if you think you can handle a lawyer with supernatural powers, you've got real fun here. The beautiful hotel adorns the Scottish Baronial styles, is covered with fir-topped Canadian Rockies, and offers access to Jasper and Banff ski resorts.",

        description: "Sylvan Hills and the majestic mountains, the thunder of the church bells and the rocky hillsides of medieval cities such as Sibiu, Brasov and Cluj, all add to the horror of this vast region in central Romania. But there is one place that brings cold and holds back: Bran Castle. This high turret tower flutters from the forests on the edge of the Wallachia tower of Gothic towers and a crisp roof. Over the years it was associated with a number of lesser-known, mysterious figures: Vlad the Impaler, a bloodthirsty representative of Wallachian kings, and Count Dracula, the Nosferatu nail biting archetype.",

        description: "Just south of the unnamed city of Szczecin in eastern Poland, a remote area west of the German border, a small branch of more than 400 pine trees has been attracting attention of Atlas Obscura species and the track-the-beat-track. they do not travel for years. The whole forest appears to be bent more than 90 degrees in the trunk, before it turns straight and grows straight into the Slavic sky. The debate has intensified as to what caused the extraordinary wood to look like it, with widespread ideas such as hurricanes and methods of planting lumber.",

Sinhai is said to have tried to seduce the young man by giving him a love potion. The plan backfired, the witch finally died, but before she could put her hat on all the residents of Bhangarh. Today, the Mughlai complex once marched by Madho Singh I is considered one of the most popular in India. No one is allowed to enter in the evening, the locals have even reported death because of the ongoing curse!",

Some say it was a rebel rally under the flag of Owain Glynd Isar, a Wales war hero against Henry IV. Some say that there was once a court where criminals could not only be sentenced to death but also hanged, all under the orders of the infamous hanging Judge, George Jeffreys. There's even a hanging curtain hanging from the ceiling inside, as well as ghost stories you can hear over your cawl (traditional Welsh soup)!",

        description: "Enter the winding paths through Chestnut Ridge Park and discover the hidden wonder of Shale Creek. Named, appropriately, Eternal Flame Falls, this curious natural phenomenon is a real mystery that you can see. Why? Well, because it can combine two world powers into one, that's why! You will start by seeing the beautiful falls on their own, which fall on rocky cliffs. Then came the flames that seemed to glow in the background. It does not extinguish, and scientists say that the eruption was caused by the presence of natural gas from the underground atmosphere.",

For years scientists have been perplexed by the seemingly endless supply of magic that has been discovered. Some think it was the result of an asteroid centuries ago. Some say it was a simple natural process of geological attrition and erosion. And then there are those who think it was the creation of extra-terrestrials, who pass this way and mark the place where they are visited in the world.",

Located on a smack bang in the middle of the Nevadan desert, the area has been kept secret by the United States government since it began building test planes and spies back in the 50s. Today, speculators speculate that it could be anything from a public watch station to a climate control station to a time travel station.",

        description: "Deep in the heart of the lush green landscape of south-central England, where the Salisbury Plain emerges from the peaks and tributaries of the oak forests, Stonehenge has long been revealing mysteries and magic. Created about 5,000 years ago, this round megalith is thought to be made of the unique bluestone that may have been excavated from the Preseli Hills in Pembrokeshire, about 200 miles from Wales. The mystery revolves around both how the Neolithic people were able to move such large stones all the way, and the purpose of the building.",
